# CMIS-141-Project-1
####An introductory project to become familiarized with inputs and outputs.

This program asks the user to input information such as birthday, location, and gpa. Then, formats the data to be output to the console.

_Note: This project was originally named "Homework1.java". This is why the pdf reflects the execution of "Homework1.java" instead of "Project1.java"._

###### This project was assigned while attending University of Maryland University College (UMUC)
